# OpenGL-Playground

OpenGL project to test things and to implement things from the OpenGL 4 Cookbook (improved) / CG lectures / own ideas

OpenGL-Version:
* 4.3 and up should work (right now)

Used libraries:
* ImGui: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui
* Assimp (tested with 3.3.1)
* glfw3 (tested with 3.2.1)
* glew (tested with 2.0.0)
* glm (tested with 0.9.8.4)

### example1
* A rotating Triangle

### example2
* A fuzzy circle (made to test SSBOs)

### example 3
* Flat Shading (per vertex), results depend heavily on geometry
* Unnecessary use of SSBOs

### example 4
* Phong Shading (per fragment, obviously)
* only difference to example 3 is the shader
* Unnecessary use of SSBOs
